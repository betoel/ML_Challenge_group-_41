### Tasks descriptions

- Feature engineering A: Frequency lists for abstracts and titles. (Jamie)
- Feature engineering B: Obtaining vectors/one hot econding to represent occurrences of keywords in abstracts and titles. (Diego)
- Feature engineering C: Employ the apriori algorithm to find the most common bundles of keywords (Diego)



### Tasks

- Keywords+Authors: Which kewords are the most powerful to predict authors (Jamie)
- Title+Abstarct: Correlate longer/shorter abstracts with certain authors (Jamie)
- XGBoost (Jamie)

- Keywords+Authors: Which keyywords are associated to which authors (Diego)
- Keywords: Association rules (Diego)
- Forest models initial pototype (Diego)

- Venues: Do the same venue appear under different names? + Linking authors to venues (Cheyenne)
- Venue+Location: Associate a given venue with its geographic location (Cheyenne)
- Venues+Authors: Which percentage of an author's paper were presented in a given venue (Cheyenne)

- Venues+Year: Are they correlated? (Betoel)
- Author+Year: See to which extent author concentrate/spread their activity around a number of years (Betoel)



### Other ideas

- Feature engineering: Highly similar features - worth delete one?
